# PHP-Javascript-Website
2nd Year Project Middlesex University. This website has a game, registration, login, ranking. 


You will need XAMPP or similar to run. This was a second year project that required you to build a website using Javascript, PHP, HTML, CSS. Website should also have a functioning user registration and login system that allowed users to play the game and their score would be displayed on the ranking page.

No databases were used, just basic HTML LocalStorage.
